// Include details about any licenses and how to sign up. Provide links as appropriate. If no licenses are required, clarify that. The following paragraphs provide examples of details you can provide. Remove italics, and rephrase as appropriate.

Before you deploy any of the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start templates, you must accept a Qumulo subscription in the AWS Marketplace for your AWS account. 

NOTE: The templates documented in this guide are more comprehensive than those available by default in the AWS Marketplace, so donâ€™t deploy from the AWS Marketplace. Accept the offer for the subscription of interest, and close the AWS Marketplace session.
