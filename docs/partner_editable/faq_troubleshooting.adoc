== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// Customize this answer if needed. For example, if you’re deploying on Linux instances, either provide the location for log files on Linux or omit the final sentence. If the Quick Start has no EC2 instances, revise accordingly (something like "and the assets keep running").

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].


== Troubleshooting

=== Find the UUID for the cluster

The Provisioning instance grabs a copy of the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the cluster after the first quorum is formed. Knowing the UUID may be necessary for troubleshooting future stack updates. Go to **Parameter Store** and filter on the top-level stack name. The following parameters are stored by the Provisioning instance. The UUID is last on the list. Select it to view the UUID.

=== Find the cluster admin password

If you have forgotten the password it can be retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager as follows:

. Open https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager[Secrets Manager] in the AWS Console
. Choose *Secrets*, and filter on the top-level stack name. 
. Look for *ClusterSecrets* and then select *Retrieve secret value*.

If the admin password is changed post-deployment, it must be updated in Secrets Manager for stack updates to function correctly.

=== The stack failed on the nested stack AWSVPCSTACK or CloudQStack

The S3 Bucket, Key Name Prefix, or Object URL are not correct when deploying from your own S3 bucket. Delete the stack and relaunch
the template with the correct S3 parameters. Do NOT use the S3 URL, use the Object URL for
the template or the stack will fail.  If deploying from the AWS Quick Start bucket do not change the bucket name, prefix, or region for the bucket.

=== The stack failed when provisioning the QSTACK

The four most common causes for this are:

1. An AWS Marketplace offer has not been accepted that matches the **Qumulo AWS Marketplace Offering Accepted** parameter entered in the template
2. The EBS volumes configuration doesn’t match the requirements for the **Qumulo AMI ID** entered when using the Specified-AMI-ID option
3. The cluster failed to place in the placement group
4. Service Quotas were not pre-planned and the QSTACK failed. 

Review the AMI ID and marketplace subscriptions. Double check the EBS volume config selected in the template. If the cluster failed to place, choose a different AZ to deploy the cluster in to find more available resources by selecting a different private subnet ID within the VPC. Adjust Service Quotas if necessary. Delete the failed stack and relaunch the template after rectifying the problem.

=== The stack update failed and rolled back

No harm is done. No Qumulo Cluster parameters for the QSTACK, except the Number of EC2 Instances, can be changed. The number of instances can’t be decreased.

=== The cluster didn’t form quorum

If the quorum has not been formed the UI will appear as below.  DO NOT form quorum manually because the provisioning instance will not
be able to complete secondary provisioning of the cluster and AWS infrastructure.

The four most common causes for this are:

1. The software version specified in the template doesn’t exist
2. The software version specified in the template is older than the AMI software version
3. The VPC doesn't have public internet access
4. The VPC doesn’t have public internet access and the upgrade image(s) were not placed in the /upgrade folder in the S3 bucket, see see **The Provisioning instance didn’t shut down**

Check for typos by reviewing the parameters entered in the template in the CloudFormation
console. Double check the software version specified for the cluster and make sure it is equal
to or newer than the version the Marketplace offer lists. Rectify and restart the Provisioning instance or delete the stack and redeploy.

=== The provisioning instance didn’t shut down

In most use cases the provisioning instance will shutdown in 5 minutes or less after the stack has completed deployment.  If the Provisioning instance hasn't shutdown after 15 minutes there's likely an issue.  Each software upgrade takes ~4 minutes.  The instances are upgraded in parallel so instance count has a minimal impact on execution time.  If you have an AMI ID with an older software verison it may have to do multiple upgrades to get the cluster on the desired version.  See the *AWS Parameter Store last-run-status* section below.

==== Common causes

The four most common causes for this are:

1. The VPC doesn’t have access to the public Internet or DNS resolution is not functioning.  Without access to public infrastructure the Provisioning instance can’t talk to AWS services like Secrets Manager, KMS, Parameter Store, or download the desired version of Qumulo Core software.  Review the public and private subnets, their route tables, and the NAT Gateway.  Review the AWS Parameter Store *last-run-status* to verify public internet connectivity (see the section below on last-run-status). Also double check that there are no Network ACLs blocking traffic.
2. The VPC doesn’t have access to the public Internet, but this was planned.  One or more VPC Endpoints may be missing.  The VPC Interface Endpoints Security Group is not correct.  The desired Qumulo Core software version has not been placed in the S3 Bucket /upgrade folder.  See the section *Deploying without Internet Access*.
3. A Customer Managed Key was provisioned and the policy was unable to be modified for the CMK because the policy didn’t have valid SIDs before the template was launched.
4. A stack update was executed to add nodes.  The stack update succeeded but the provisioning instance didn’t shutdown and the nodes were not added to the cluster.  Most likely the Cluster’s admin password was changed post deployment.  If this is the case go to *Secrets Manager*, filter on the top-level stack name, and look for *ClusterSecrets*.  *Retrieve secret value* and *Edit*.  Update the admin password and save the secret.  Then stop and restart the provisioning instance.

Cleanup the CMK, correct the VPC infrastructure, update the admin password and restart the provisioning instance.  See the sections that follow on restarting the provisioning instance, monitoring its status in the Parameter Store, and downloading logs.

==== AWS Parameter Store last-run-status

If the Provisioning instance doesn’t automatically shutdown, the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store *last-run-status* parameter may be checked to see where it stopped.  As shown below, the parameter history shows the major blocks in the code the provisioning instance executes.  In this example QCluster1 was built for the first time as noted by the *Forming first quorum and configuring cluster* update to the last-run-status parameter.  Note that two software upgrades were also performed per the Qumulo quarterly cadence to reach the 4.2.0 software release.

==== Restarting the Provisioning Instance

The Provisioning instance is designed to restart with every Stack Update.  Further, it may be manually stopped from the AWS Console, if it doesn’t automatically stop, and then manually restarted.  Examples where this may be very helpful are if software wasn’t placed in the S3 bucket when deploying without internet access, a CMK policy wasn’t cleaned up prior to deployment, or intended internet connectivity wasn’t functioning as expected and has been rectified.

==== Download the Provisioning instance log

In the event none of the troubleshooting steps help to rectify the problems it’s likely the
Provisioning instance log will be helpful. To retrieve the log follow these steps:

1. Go to the AWS Console **EC2 Instances** page
2. **Check the box** beside the Provisioning instance
3. Select **Actions** in the upper right corner
4. Select **Monitor & troubleshoot**
5. Select **Get system log**
6. Select Download in the upper right corner

Feel free to review the log right in the AWS console or download it to collaborate with Qumulo
to resolve the problem. Often the log will show an obvious error pointing you to the
resolution.

==== Provisioning instance flow chart

The provisioning instance executes the code in user data every boot cycle. The abbreviated
logic diagram below shows the major branches and AWS SSM Parameter Store values for
**last-run-status** throughout the execution of the code.
