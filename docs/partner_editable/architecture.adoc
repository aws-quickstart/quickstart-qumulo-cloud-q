Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

image::../images/qumulo-cloud-q-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnet:
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.

* In the private subnet:
** A cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, or nodes, that run the Qumulo Core software.
** Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, which store the files in the Qumulo cluster.
** A provisioner EC2 instance, which automatically shuts down after provisioning the Qumulo cluster and automatically restarts during stack updates.
** (Optional) An Amazon Route 53 hosted zone to configure DNS A records for the cluster.
* (Optional) A Network Load Balancer to distribute traffic to between the nodes in the Qumulo cluster.
* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to store a private key.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage roles.
* Amazon CloudWatch to log metrics for the Qumulo cluster.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send alerts for EBS volume anomalies.
* AWS Lambda to collect metrics for the Qumulo cluster and monitor EBS volume health. (Qumulo calls Lambda functions "Sidecar" functions.)
