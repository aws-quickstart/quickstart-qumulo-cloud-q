Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

image::../images/qumulo-cloud-q-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnet:
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.

* In the private subnet:
** A cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for Qumulo Core.
** A cluster of Qumulo EC2 instances.
*** 4 to 20 nodes.
*** 1 TB to 6 PB of usable capacity.
** Multiple Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes connected to the Qumulo cluster.
*** 28 unique EBS volume configurations (disk configs) are available.
*** All flash (solid state drive, or SSD) and hybrid (SSD + hard disk drive, or HDD) disk configs are available.
** A provisioner EC2 instance, which automatically shuts down after provisioning the Qumulo cluster and automatically restarts during stack updates.
** (Optional) An Amazon Route 53 hosted zone. With this option, which is available when you use Route 53 to resolve all DNS for the VPC, you can provision a Route 53 hosted zone to configure DNS A records for the cluster.
* (Optional) A Network Load Balancer (with an elastic IP address) to distribute traffic to ____.
//TODO Dave, Please complete the above bullet. (Note: I moved that icon out of the subnet in the diagram.)
* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to store a private key.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage roles.
* Amazon CloudWatch to log metrics for the Qumulo cluster.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send alerts for EBS volume anomalies.
* AWS Lambda to collect metrics for the Qumulo cluster and monitor EBS-volume health.
