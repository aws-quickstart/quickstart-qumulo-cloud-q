Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, in two Availability Zones, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public production subnet:
** A managed Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound Internet access for resources in the private subnet.
** (Optional) A network load balancer with an elastic IP address
* In the private production subnet:
** A cluster of Qumulo EC2 instances
*** 4 to 20 nodes
*** 1TB to 6PB of usable capacity
** Multiple AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes connected to the Qumulo cluster
*** 28 unique EBS Volume configurations (ie Disk Configs) are available
*** All flash (SSD) and Hybrid (SSD+HDD) Disk Configs are available
** Two Qumulo Sidecar Lambda functions
*** One Lambda function sends Qumulo cluster metrics to Cloudwatch
*** The other Lambda function monitors the health of EBS volumes and automatically replaces any unhealthy volumes
** (Optional) AWS Route 53 private hosted zone
*** If R53 is resolving all DNS for the VPC then a R53 private hosted zone may be optionally provisioned to configure DNS A records for the cluster.
** A Provisioner EC2 Instance, which automatically shuts down after provisioning the Qumulo cluster and automatically restarts during stack updates.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
