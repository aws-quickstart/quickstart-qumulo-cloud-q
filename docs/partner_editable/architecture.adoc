Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

//TODO Marcia still to fine-tune the editing here and throughout.

image::../images/qumulo-cloud-q-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnet:
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.
** (Optional) A network load balancer with an elastic IP address.
* In the private subnet:
** A cluster of Qumulo EC2 instances.
*** 4 to 20 nodes.
*** 1TB to 6PB of usable capacity.
** Multiple AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes connected to the Qumulo cluster.
*** 28 unique EBS Volume configurations (ie Disk Configs) are available
*** All flash (SSD) and Hybrid (SSD+HDD) Disk Configs are available.
** (Optional) an AWS Route 53 private hosted zone.
*** If R53 is resolving all DNS for the VPC then a R53 private hosted zone may be optionally provisioned to configure DNS A records for the cluster.
** A provisioner EC2 instance, which automatically shuts down after provisioning the Qumulo cluster and automatically restarts during stack updates.
* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to store a private key.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage roles.
* Amazon CloudWatch to log Qumulo cluster metrics.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) alerts triggered by EBS volume anomalies.
* AWS Lambda functions to collect Qumulo cluster metrics and monitor EBS volume health.
