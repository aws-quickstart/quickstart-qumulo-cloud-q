==== Allow Qumulo public access if you use AWS Direct Connect

If you use https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/[AWS Direct Connect^] to connect between an on-premises environment and your AWS VPC, and if you restrict public access to specific URLs with a corporate firewall, ensure that your firewall allows access to the following Qumulo public URLs. Since these URLs' public IP addresses may occasionally change, allow access to the URL if you can. If you can't, allow access to the IP address resolved.
