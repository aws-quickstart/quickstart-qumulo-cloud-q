// Edit this placeholder text to accurately describe your architecture.

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateway, security groups, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into the new VPC. By default, this option deploys a Route 53 private hosted zone to resolve IP addresses.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure. If your VPC already has a means of DNS resolution—for example, if you use Active Directory—you will not need to deploy a Route 53 private hosted zone.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.

If you're interested in deploying into an existing VPC using an advanced template that has a larger set of parameters, see ____.

//TODO Dave, please review my edited description of the `DomainName` parameter in the templates. The existing-VPC standard template doesn't have a description for this parameter, so I put the whole description in the new-VPC template ... but people using that template should never leave the value blank, right? That seems to be the default, which contradicts what we say above. I'm sure that I don't have that parameter descriptions accurate yet in all three templates.
