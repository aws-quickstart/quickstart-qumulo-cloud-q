This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC with advanced parameters*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateway, security groups, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into the new VPC and exposes all parameter options for full flexibility.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC with advanced parameters*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure and exposes all parameter options for full flexibility.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC with standard parameters*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure with the minimal set of required parameters.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.

//TODO Dave, please review my edited description of the `DomainName` parameter in the templates. The existing-VPC standard template doesn't have a description for this parameter, so I put the whole description in the new-VPC template ... but people using that template should never leave the value blank, right? That seems to be the default, which contradicts what we say above. I'm sure that I don't have that parameter descriptions accurate yet in all three templates.

//Marcia, I've updated the new VPC template description.
