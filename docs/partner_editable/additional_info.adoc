== Test the deployment

Follow these steps to verify that the cluster formed quorum, that the number of nodes in the cluster matches what you specified, and that your data is protected.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[CloudFormation^] console, and select the top-level stack name. 
. Choose *Outputs*. A list of URLs appears.
. Copy the appropriate URL from the *Value* column, and paste it into your browser as follows: 
+
* If you deployed Route 53, copy the URL for the private addresses, resolved by Route 53. 
* If you did not deploy Route 53, copy the URL for the first node's primary IP address. 
* If you chose public management, copy the URL to the Elastic IP (public static) address. 
* If connecting via the public internet, copy the *QumuloPublicIP* URL, and open a page from your local machine. 
* If connecting from within your VPC, copy the *QumuloPrivateIP* URL, and paste it into the browser of an EC2 instance running Chrome.

. Log in to the Qumulo console using the user name and administrator password you provided during deployment. When you see the Qumulo dashboard, shown in <<additional19>>, you know that your cluster formed quorum.

If you are not prompted for a user name and password and see the End User Agreement screen instead, the cluster failed to form quorum. See the troubleshooting section link:#_the_cluster_didnt_form_quorum[The cluster didn't form quorum].

. Choose *More details*. Verify that the number of nodes listed matches the number you specified, that each node has a green checkmark in the *Status* column, and that the term *Data Protected* in the middle of the screen has a shield icon next to it [or...?], as shown in <<additional20>>.

//TODO Dack: In step 3 above, the five bullets are not mutually exclusive. For example, what if we did not deploy Route 53 (bullet 2) AND we're connecting from within our VPC (bullet 5)? How can we make it clearer exactly which URL people copy and exactly where they paste it in each scenario? 

//TODO Dack: In the last step, for data protection, is the shield icon the thing we look for? If not, specifically what should we verify?

//TODO Dack: Also in the last step, what should we do if something isn't right on this screen (number of nodes, green checkmarks, or data protection)?

== Postdeployment steps

=== (Optional) Set up Multi-AZ for disaster recovery and business continuity

For disaster recovery and business continuity, you can use Qumulo DR to deploy one or more clusters in other Availability Zones or AWS Regions. For more information, see ____.

//TODO Add link from Dack.

//TODO Dack, what is Qumulo DR? I see Qumulo Recover Q on your website (https://qumulo.com/solution/recover-q/) ... is that maybe what we want to refer to?

=== (Optional) Copy data into your cluster from an S3 bucket

Qumulo Core supports copying data to and from an Amazon S3 bucket using Qumulo Shift for Amazon S3. After your cluster is up and running, you may populate data on it by copying data from a chosen S3 bucket. To create a Shift job, log in to the Qumulo console, choose *Cluster*, *Copy to/from S3*, and fill in the parameters. 

For more information on the Qumulo Shift feature set, UI, and CLI, see the following:

* https://github.com/Qumulo/docs/blob/gh-pages/shift-from-s3.md[Qumulo SHIFT - Copy from S3^]
* https://care.qumulo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053162273-Qumulo-Shift-for-Amazon-S3[Qumulo SHIFT - Copy to S3^]

//TODO Dack, That first link's link text says "Copy from S3," but I don't see that phrase on that page. What should the link text say?

//TODO Dack, The second link goes to a page that says, "This content has moved." Where do you want to point instead?
